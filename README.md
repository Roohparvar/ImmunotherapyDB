- **DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1444](https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1444)

## Overview
This dataset contains single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq data from patients with **Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)** receiving neoadjuvant treatments. The study aimed to evaluate peripheral blood and tumor T cells in response to PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab) combined with chemoradiation, compared to chemoradiation alone.  

## Treatments
- Anti-PD-1 + Chemoradiation (CRT)  
- CRT only  

## Patients
- **Number of unique patients:** 3  

## Sample Types
- **Tissue:** Blood vs Tumor  

## Timepoints / Treatment Status
- **Pre-Infusion / Before treatment:** samples collected before PD-1 blockade  
- **Post-Infusion / After treatment:** samples collected after PD-1 blockade  

## Notes
- Single-cell data includes both gene expression (GEX) and TCR sequences.  
- Longitudinal samples available for patients receiving PD-1 blockade.  
- Metadata includes patient ID, tissue, timepoint, treatment, and response information.
